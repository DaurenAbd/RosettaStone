//! This class is where the action takes place, representing the board on which
//! each game is played out. Around the battlefield are various important UI
//! elements, such as each player's hand, deck and Mana Crystals, as well as the
//! two heroes themselves. Each battlefield features its own design and numerous
//! interactive elements, but play is in no way affected or determined by
//! battlefield selection. Battlefields are chosen at random and are independent
//! of the heroes chosen by players or used by the Innkeeper.
